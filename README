ABOUT THE PROJECT:
The files in this repository are part of the simulations I used for my TCP-Performance evaluation in 802.11 networks research. 
Please copy them to <ns2 installation directory>/ns-2.35/tcl/ex/snoop before running them.

All the simulations are accompanied by a NAM animation and an xgraph generated chart of the throughput.

HOW TO USE:
ns <filename.tcl>
